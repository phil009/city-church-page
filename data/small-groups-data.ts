      "Hi, we’re Adebayo and Joy — married for 13 years+, blessed with a son and a daughter. We love God, we love people, and we deeply love marriages that thrive.There’s something truly beautiful about seeing couples still holding hands in their 80s, 90s, or even a hundred. That’s the kind of legacy we want. But let’s be real — good marriages don’t just happen. They take intentionality, commitment, and a shared desire to grow. One of the best things we've done for our marriage recently is partnering with another couple we admire to become what we now call 'Accountability Couples'. It's not your typical 'accountability partner' setup — this is two couples showing up for each other, committed to learning, growing, and holding space for honest conversations. Every week, we meet to share openly, learn from each other’s experiences, and challenge ourselves to love more deeply and intentionally. It’s been eye-opening, healing, and truly rewarding. And now, we want to extend the invite: If you're passionate about seeing your marriage not just survive, but flourish, and you’d love to grow in a safe, supportive space with other couples — then this might just be for you. We’re building a community of intentional couples who are doing the work — together. And we’d love to have you join us on this journey. Let’s grow together. Let’s thrive — not just for now, but for the long haul.",

      "Too often I have seen people begin in church and end up using their gifts cultivated in church to serve the world or serve self or serve the enemy wittingly or unwittingly. Most forget I John 3:15-17 admonition that we should not love the world. They face Giants in the mould of corruption, validation, riches, influence, leadership deficit etc. In Nigeria today there are many giants and instead of seeing them as challenges we have to see them as opportunity for greatness. This is a group meant to practically apply the word to everyday life to equip young professionals and semi professionals to take on giants and win like David did with his mighty men.",

That’s why I am starting this small group a place where we grow together and learn how to love like Jesus.

      "After saying 'yes' to Jesus over a decade ago, the presumed '360 transformation' didn't happen. I wandered, got entangled in choices that dimmed the light within me. I knew of God, but I didn't walk so close to His heart, carrying guilt like a shadow, convinced I had strayed too far. But mercy has a way of finding us in our mess. And in my lowest, He whispered love, not wrath. Grace didn’t just knock, it broke down walls I built in shame. The road of faith has not been smooth for me; it’s been a soul-battling terrain where my flaws tried to drown my fire, and doubt often danced too close. Yet even in my stumbling, Jesus stayed. He didn’t wait for perfection; He walked with me in my imperfection. He made each scar a story, each fall a lesson, and each tear a prayer. I’ve tasted both the ache of failure and the sweetness of redemption. And still, I rise, not because I have it all together, but because His love holds me together. Through it all, His faithfulness has remained my anchor, steady in every storm.",
